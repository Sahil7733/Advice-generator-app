# Advice Generator App

This is a simple Advice Generator App built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com). The app fetches random pieces of advice from the API and displays them on the page. The advice can be regenerated by clicking on the dice button.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The app is optimized for both mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px) views.
- **Random Advice Generation**: Click the dice button to fetch a random piece of advice.
- **Hover Effects**: The interactive elements (like the dice button) have hover states for better user experience.
- **Unlimited Advice Fetching**: Fetch new advice as many times as you want by clicking the button.
